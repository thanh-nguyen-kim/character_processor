# Character Processor

<https://killertee.wordpress.com/about/>

A helper script to prepare text asset which is used in TextMesh Pro Font Asset creating.
If you install the package using UPM, SampleScene.unity is read-only thus it can't be opened. Drag SampleScene.unity from the package into your project then you can open it as normal.

## Remove duplicate character from a text file

+ Drag the text asset in the "OriginText" field.
+ Press Play.
+ The ***_output.txt should appear in StreamingAssets.

## Remove common characters between origin text and a set of blueprint texts

+ Drag the text asset in the "OriginText" field.
+ Drag the blueprint texts in "BluePrintTexts" field.
+ Press Play.
+ The ***_output.txt should appear in StreamingAssets.
